# This hypothetical protocol is designed to test how well jsub copes with splitting a single protocol into two types of summary files:
# First, a single summary file in which only ".vars" (i.e. shared or global variables) and not ".fvars" (e.g. sample IDs from a list) are involved.
# Second, multiple summary files of what is to be done to individual samples.

# This part should make a single summary file.
